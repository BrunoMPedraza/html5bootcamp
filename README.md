### **Objective**

This course teaches the basics of modern Web UI development.
We want to help you create the best of breed user experiences, gaming, and mobile applications.

→ [index](#index)

### **Who Should Attend**

The training will start at a low level, and does not require in depth knowledge of the platform in question.
Desirable participant profile: trainees and outside Globant candidates.

A basic knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is desired, though.

### **Duration**

Five weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and two weeks for app development.

→ [index](#index)

### **Technical Assistance**

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance.
We will create one chat for bootcamp members only, and another one for bootcamp members and tutors when it starts.

### **Performance Measurement**

To measure performance and quality we will

*   Make periodic code review to the finished exercises.

*   Measure if exercises are finished on time and shape.

*   Measure team work.

→ [index](#index)


### **Handling Advanced Developers**

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted.

→ [index](#index)

### **Tools**

Below is a full list of all tools that will be needed to complete the Bootcamp.

1.  At least, three different browsers installed on the developer machine.As Example:

    *   Chrome
    *   Firefox
    *   Android browser using Android's emulator


2.  Any IDE available for Web Development.

    *   [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   [Atom](https://atom.io/)

3.  Google Hangouts for calls. Skype might be required too.

4.  Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account.

5.  [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).

6.  NodeJS server.

    *   Install `http-server` globally, by running `npm install -g http-server`.
    *   To start the server, from a command line interface, run `http-server` in the directory where you will clone the startup repo.
    *   Open your web browser and point to localhost:PORT (the `http-server` should have outputted the number of PORT you should use)

7.  Fork [Startup repository](https://github.com/globant-ui/startup) to use as a base to host the project code.

### **General Guidelines**

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1.  The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning.
    Each topic will have reading and practices parts.
    Tutors will be available to answer technical questions.

2.  The next week will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3.  All the exercises must work within a mobile environment.

4.  Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

5.  All code and documentation **must** be in English.

6.  Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [HTML](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide), [CSS](https://github.com/globant-ui/css-style-guide) and [JavaScript](https://github.com/globant-ui/JavaScript-style-guide) coding guidelines.

### **Learning Days**

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for the next generation mobile apps: yeah, web apps! Web apps powered by the latest, and coolest toolkits, and techniques.

On each learning day you will have to:

1.  **Read:** We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2.  **Practice:** You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
    Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention.
    If you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3.  **Commit:** YOu will commit all your code as soon as you finish each exercise. If not you must commit your work in a daily basis.

#### **Introduction**

At high level you could see the keys as:

![technologies logos](assets/html5-css-javascript.png "The platform")

HTML describes the content semantics and structure of a web page. It was designed as a markup language, if you know XML, you could consider HTML as a subset of XML with a predefined semantic.

On the other hand, CSS allows to define the look and feel of the content. It's used to set colors on HTML elements, customize sizes, define the layout of the document content, among others. (e.x. "The following list of elements must be shown as a menu", "The main title of the page should use this particular font").

JavaScript is a programming language that runs in all Web Browsers. Using JavaScript we can create full-fledge web applications.

Now that you know which are the three pilars of a web application's UI, it's time to dive into them.

    *   [Topic 0: Git](git)

    *   [Topic 1: HTML](html)

    *   [Topic 2: CSS](css)

    *   [Topic 3: JavaScript and DOM APIs](javascript-basics)

    *   [Topic 4: OOP and Inheritance in JavaScript](javascript-oop)

    *   [Topic 5: Frameworks] (frameworks)

    *   [Topic 6: HTML5 APIs](html5-apis)

### Final Project

#### **It’s time for the real thing**

You will work on a project to achieve a fully working multi platform mobile web app developed in JavaScript.

You will use all the knowledge obtained during the learning weeks.

Will you be able to consult documentation? Of course!

You will be able to use any resource you know that helps you complete your project, be it going back to documentation sites, tutorials or just googling what you need.

Luckily the web has plenty of awesome resources waiting for you to grasp them!

#### **Project Topics**

As we mentioned you will be working on a project, but you might be asking which project you will develop... Well we provide you the possibility to choose between several projects we have designed for the Bootcamp.

If you desire you can choose some other topic that is not listed down below the ones we have. If this is the case please share with us you idea!!!

Here is a full list of all the topics we propose

*   [Game Character Application](projects/game-character-app)
*   [Movies Web Application](projects/movies-app)
*   [Spotify Web Application](projects/spotify-app)
*   [Twitter Web Application](projects/twitter-app)

#### **Reviews**

Mentors will give you feedback at the end of the project by reviewing your committed code in GitHub.
